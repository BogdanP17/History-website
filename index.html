          <h3>Stonehenge</h3>

          <img src="./assets/images/stonehenge.jpg" id="stonepic" />
          <p>
            Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument on Salisbury Plain in
            Wiltshire, England, two miles (3 km) west of Amesbury. It consists
            of an outer ring of vertical sarsen standing stones, each around 13
            feet (4.0 m) high, seven feet (2.1 m) wide, and weighing around 25
            tons, topped by connecting horizontal lintel stones. Inside is a
            ring of smaller bluestones. Inside these are free-standing
            trilithons, two bulkier vertical sarsens joined by one lintel. The
            whole monument, now ruinous, is aligned towards the sunrise on the
            summer solstice. The stones are set within earthworks in the middle
            of the densest complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in
            England, including several hundred tumuli (burial mounds).

            Petra is a famous archaeological site in Jordan's southwestern
            desert. Dating to around 300 B.C., it was the capital of the
            Nabatean Kingdom. Accessed via a narrow canyon called Al Siq, it
            contains tombs and temples carved into pink sandstone cliffs,
            earning its nickname, the "Rose City.Perhaps its most famous
            structure is 45m-high Al Khazneh, a temple with an ornate,
            Greek-style facade, and known as The Treasury.

          <p>
            Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains in
            Peru, above the Urubamba River valley. Built in the 15th century and
            later abandoned, it is renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone
            walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, intriguing
            buildings that play on astronomical alignments and panoramic views.
            Its exact former use remains a mystery.

            The Giza pyramid complex in Egypt is home to the Great Pyramid, the
            Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, along with their
            associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx. All were built
            during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of ancient Egypt,
            between 2600 and 2500 BC.
